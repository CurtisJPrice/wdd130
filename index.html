        Eagle Creek, Oregon, is an unincorporated community named after the local stream, which was likely named for the eagles that frequented the area. 
        The community was established in the mid-1800s, with a post office opening in 1867. 
        Philip Foster, a prominent figure in early Oregon history, played a key role in the area's development, establishing a farm and mill. 
        Eagle Creek is also known for its access to the Eagle Creek Trail, a popular hiking destination in the Mount Hood National Forest.
